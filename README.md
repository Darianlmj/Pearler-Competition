### 1. About the Project

This is a simple web application that allows users to plan a savings goal based on their current age and the age that they want to acheive this savings goal by. The website will then calculate how much the user will have to save per week (in that timeframe) in order for them to achieve this goal.

In addition to this, the user is also able to reduce the timeframe to acheive this by setting their own expected savings per week. This will then recalculate the number of weeks it will take them to reach this goal.

The website also features an extremely easy and friendly user experience, a low learning curve for users new to the website, and a user interface that is similar to the popular Australian investing app called [Pearler](https://pearler.com/).
